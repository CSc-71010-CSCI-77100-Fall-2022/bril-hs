Running this program requires the basic bril installation and associated tools, 
which can be found on the bril repo: https://github.com/sampsyo/bril

It also requires a Haskell installation with Stack as the build system, 
however the code is mainly self contained at this point so it shouldn't be difficult 
to move the code into a different setting/build system.
